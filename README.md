cppuuid
=======

C++ UUID support inspired by [Python's UUID](https://docs.python.org/2/library/uuid.html) package. For more details see:

    http://docs.python.org/library/uuid.html

As long as the underlying hardware clock has a resolution greater than 100ns, this code can produce type-1 UUIDs at a rate greater than 10 million per second. There is a small demo in main.cpp.

## Building
To build the example program simply execute `make`.
